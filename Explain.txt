# Go-API: Project Breakdown

This file explains the "How" and "Why" of our project structure and logic, following a step-by-step learning journey.

---

### Step 1: The Foundation
We start by initializing the Go module and creating an industry-standard directory structure.
- **Why?** It ensures the project stays organized as it grows.
- **Key Files**: `main.go`, `go.mod`

### Step 2: The Data Layer
Connecting to MongoDB using environment variables.
- **Why?** Moving secrets to `.env` makes the app secure and portable.
- **Key Files**: `internal/config/databaseConnection.go`, `.env`

### Step 3: Plaintext Auth (Concept)
Understanding how to map incoming JSON requests to Go structs.
- **Why?** You need to understand the data flow before adding security.
- **Key Files**: `internal/models/userModel.go`, `internal/routes/authRouter.go`

### Step 4: The Secret Scramble (Bcrypt)
Replacing plaintext passwords with secure hashes.
- **Why?** To protect user data in case of a database breach.
- **Key Files**: `internal/controllers/usersController.go` (Signup and Login logic)

### Step 5: The Digital Handshake (JWT)
Issuing secure tokens for session management.
- **Why?** Stateless authentication is scalable and modern.
- **Key Files**: `internal/handler/authHelper.go`

### Step 6: The Guard (Middleware)
Protecting routes with an automatic security check.
- **Why?** Centralized security avoids "forgotten" unprotected routes.
- **Key Files**: `internal/middleware/authMiddleware.go`, `internal/routes/userRouter.go`

### Step 7: Mastering the API
Implementing advanced database queries and pagination.
- **Why?** Keeping the API fast and efficient for production loads.
- **Key Files**: `internal/controllers/usersController.go` (GetUsers logic)
